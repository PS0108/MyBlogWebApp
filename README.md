This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

About Project:
This is my blog website, which is focussed on "Low Latency Programming" techniques.
It focusses on my opinion towards the Do's and Dont's while developing such applications.

Notes:
1. The website lists three different blogs, you can click on each of them to read about it in detail.
2. On the right hand side, there is a navigation panel to navigate across blogs
